# Amazon Sales Data Power BI Project

This project uses Power BI to analyze Amazon sales data. 
The goal is to generate insights on Amazon's sales performance using key metrics like Total revenue, 
Total orders, and Total quantity.

## Data Source
The raw dataset  used in this project is sourced from [Amazon Sales]("https://github.com/MJaiBhavani/amazon_sales/blob/main/Amazon%20Sale%20Report.csv")


## Files
- `https://github.com/MJaiBhavani/amazon_sales/blob/main/Amazon%20Sale%20Report.csv`: The raw dataset containing Amazon sales data.
- `https://github.com/MJaiBhavani/amazon_sales/blob/main/Amazon%20Sale%20Report_excelworkbook.xls`: The cleaned and transformed dataset used in the Power BI dashboard.
- `https://github.com/MJaiBhavani/amazon_sales/blob/main/amazon_sales_dashboard_project.pbix`: The Power BI project file that contains the dashboard and visualizations.


## Key Insights from the Dashboard:
The Power BI dashboard is built using three main parameters:
- **Total Revenue**: Displays the overall revenue from Amazon sales.
- **Total Orders**: Represents the total number of orders.
- **Total Quantity**: Shows the total quantity of products sold.

### Visualizations in the Dashboard:
#### Map Visualization:

The map visual displays the geographic distribution of sales data across different regions. It allows users to easily identify which locations have the highest sales performance, helping to uncover regional trends and insights.

#### Bar Charts:

Total Orders: This bar chart represents the total number of orders placed over time or by category, offering a clear comparison of order volumes across different periods or segments.

Total Revenue: A bar chart showing the total revenue generated by Amazon sales across various categories. This visual helps compare the revenue from different products, regions, or time periods.

Total Quantity: This chart represents the total quantity of products sold across different regions, providing insights into the volume of products moving through various markets.

#### Line Chart:

The line chart tracks trends over time for Total Orders, Total Revenue, and Total Quantity. It enables users to identify patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and growth trends in these key metrics, helping to analyze performance over different time frames.

These parameters are used in the dashboard to provide dynamic visualizations of Amazon's sales data, allowing for a deeper understanding of sales performance and trends over time.
